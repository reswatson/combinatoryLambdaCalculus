# combinatoryLambdaCalculus

A lambda calculus that is close to both supercombinators and combinators in style. Lambda terms are defined so that all the arguments must be provided for substitution to take place. A Self variable provides the ability to define combinators recursively.

In ComboLambd2.agda a working version is given along with a proof of the Church-Rosser property. This now needs to be coded in a form that is more easily tested, experimented with and used.
